# Call of Duty Project

The Call of Duty project was created as a way to help gauge an intern's comfort with foundational programming skills, such as:

* Basic flow control (if-statements, switch statements, etc.)
* Object oriented concepts (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)
* Proper usage of interfaces
* Unit testing / TDD
* Refactoring
* Architectural changes to accommodate changing requirements

After the intern completes these tasks successfully, we will move them on to projects that make use of the ASP.NET web stack.

For this project, you'll need the following environment:

* Windows (ideal but not required)
* Visual Studio Community
 
The project builds upon the skeleton code in the included ZIP file.
